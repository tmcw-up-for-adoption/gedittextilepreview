# NOTE #

This project has [Moved to GitHub!](http://github.com/tmcw/gedittextilepreview)

This is a plugin for **gedit** that provides live previews of Textile code. It's based off of [Gedit's MarkDown support](http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/MarkdownSupport), and will soon include Markdown support (as well as Textile highlighting)

## Current New Features ##

  * Opens bottom pane & focuses on the right tab
  * Live Preview

## Planned Features ##

  * Option to turn on & off the live preview
  * Unifying textile, markdown, ?, into one plugin and one nice pane.
  * Textile syntax highlighting?

## Current Install ##

  * You'll need Subversion. If you're on Ubuntu, 'sudo apt-get install subversion' in a terminal window will do the trick.
  * 'cd ~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins'
  * 'svn co http://gedittextilepreview.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ./'
  * Restart gedit, if it's running
  * You've got it! You can now go to that directory and run 'svn update' for incremental updates.
